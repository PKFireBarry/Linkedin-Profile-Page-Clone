https://pkfirebarry.github.io/Linkedin-Profile-Page-Clone/

This is a clone of the front-end for a LinkedIn profile page, created using React. The layout and design of the page closely mimic the look and feel of a LinkedIn profile page. It's built using React and also uses some CSS libraries like Material-UI. The post also includes a like, comment, repost, and send button, which is represented by icons just like a the real Linkedin. The component structure is quite simple to understand and easy to modify. Please note that this project is for educational and demonstration purposes only, and should not be used for any commercial purposes without the appropriate permissions and licenses.
