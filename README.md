#Linkedin Front-End Clone

This is a clone of the front-end for a LinkedIn profile page, created using React. The layout and design of the page closely mimic the look and feel of a LinkedIn profile page. It's built using React and also uses some CSS libraries like Material-UI. The post also includes a like, comment, repost, and send button, which is represented by icons just like a the real Linkedin. The component structure is quite simple to understand and easy to modify.
